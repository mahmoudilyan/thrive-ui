				"text": "Richard, be honest.  What was unveiled today was not a &quot;Store&quot;, but was a more polished landing page for Open AIs GPT &quot;search feature&quot; of the cream of the crop of 3 million plus GPTs that they have convinced others to make and give away for free, and nothing more. 🤔 Stores sell things and compensate the makers.  Open AI created a ton of hype and revealed almost nothing new, except the &quot;Store&quot; will only be a USA thing initially, so limitations, with still no details how revenue will be shared amongst the 3 million plus and growing GPTs.  Is it possible that Open AI rushed things with their announcement last year and are now just trying to not lose everybody&#39;s attention while they devise the details, while incorporating more user developed ideas into their next upgrade.🤔  I am all in on AI and the power of custom GPTs, especially if they can be secured and not easily copied, but I am growing concerned of the lack of transparency or any details of Open AIs plan at this time, while they continue to encourage everybody to just set their GPT&#39;s to &quot;free for anybody to use.&quot;",

				"text": "°•°• I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God&#39;s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won&#39;t last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others.",
